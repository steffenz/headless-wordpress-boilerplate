# Headless WordPress Template
This is a work in progress. As the project progresses, this README will be updated.

## What and why?
The goal of this project is to create a dead-simple boilerplate project that can spin up a WordPress with a small set of plugins to make it function headless. If everything works out, this should be as easy to spin up locally as in AWS, Azure, or anywhere else. I hate wasting time configuring WordPress - that's the big why.
